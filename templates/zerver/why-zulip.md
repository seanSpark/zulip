Zulip is not just a “better Slack”, in the same way that iPods were not just
“better CD players”. Zulip’s topic-based threading changes what is possible
in chat. If you haven’t seen Zulip in action, log on to our developers’
server at <https://chat.zulip.org>, or check out our short screencast
(coming soon) on topics and threading.

## Asynchronous matters

Zulip’s threading model allows for long-running conversations to co-exist
with real time chat. This allows remote team members, part-time contractors,
internal clients, and others who aren’t going to be on your chat full-time
to participate effectively.

## Usability matters

Email is clunky for real-time communication. A thread with even 100 messages
feels cluttered and slow, whereas real-time chat conversations (on any
platform) regularly exceed that. Typing notifications, emoji reactions,
keyboard shortcuts, and blazingly fast clients make Zulip a daily
pleasure. Usability is important; if people don’t like a communications
tool, they just won't use it.

## Zulip changes the way you operate

The Zulip project currently has over 30 full-time engineers, working from 10
different countries. Outside of one-on-one conversations, Zulip doesn’t have
a single phone or video-based meeting. Zulip also has 0 internal mailing
lists, and 0 internal email discussions.

Threaded conversations mean that all stakeholders can see and respond to
every message, just like in meetings and email. But unlike meetings, Zulip
conversations don’t require coordinating busy schedules, or hour long
commitments from folks that just need a 5 minute update. And unlike email, a
lively discussion of 300 Zulip messages is just as easy to digest and
respond to as an in-person conversation.
