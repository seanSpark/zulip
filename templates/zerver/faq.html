                    If I start out on the Zulip hosted cloud service,
                    and a few years down the line want to move to
                    running my own server, can I later export my data?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Yes!  Zulip supports exporting your organization's
                    data and then importing it into another Zulip
                    server.

                    Can I use your free hosting service just to hang

                    My organization isn't obviously eligible for your
                    free hosting plan, but we have a lot of
                    non-employee users and can't afford to pay for all
                    of them.  Do you offer discounts for this sort of
                    situation?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Yes!  Our pricing is designed to be affordable for
                    companies that are paying their users a salary.
                    If your organization is an educational institution
                    or otherwise has a lot of participants who you
                    aren't paying a salary, we can likely offer your
                    organization free or highly discounted
                    hosting.  <a href="mailto:support@zulipchat.com"
